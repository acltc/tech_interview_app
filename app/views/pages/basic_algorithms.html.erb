		<p>For many, just thinking about tech interviews can bring on a sensation of dread. The idea of this site is to help change that! With continued practice, you can increase your skills and your confidence. The first key is to recognize that being good at tech interviews is a <strong>skill that comes with practice and experience</strong>. It is our experience working with hundreds of coding bootcamp grads that while most don't nail the first tech interview, they get better with each interview.</p>
